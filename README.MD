Note: I wanted a power switch function, so I added a slide switch to the resistor of the wiring diagram. Please check the provided images.

Here are the components I used:

1. 2x RJ11 4P4C connectors
2. 4x M3 screws
3. 1x 0.1" pitch slide switch
4. 2x T type 9V battery clips
5. 1x 330-ohm resistor
6. 1x 0.47uF capacitor
7. 2x 9V batteries
8. Some heat shrink tubes
